The "Covid_Analysis.R" file encompasses the logistic regression analysis. It focuses on the top 500 health diagnosis codes and the demographics of a dataset comprising COVID-19 positive patients.

The file named "posDiag0_9_manual_vlookup.csv" is manually curated. The Excel function VLOOKUP has been utilized in this file to create the 'General' and 'sub_type' columns. These columns are derived based on the values in 'DIAGNOSIS_CD' and 'DIAGNOSIS_CD_TYPE.'

Additionally, "posDiag0_9.csv" and "posDiagSub" are subset files extracted from "posDiag0_9_manual_vlookup.csv". These subsets further refine the data for specific analyses or views.
